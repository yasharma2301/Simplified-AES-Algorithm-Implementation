# Simplified-AES-Algorithm-Implementation

Simplified AES (S-AES) was developed by Professor Edward Schaefer of Santa Clara University and several of his students. It is an educational rather than a secure encryption algorithm. It has similar properties and structure to AES with much smaller parameters.
